# Finite Element Method with Transparent Boundary Condition

To handle unbounded computational domains, we introduce Dirichlet-to-Neumann 
map (DtN) which maps the Dirichlet value to the Neumann value of the solution 
of a boundary value problem. In our problem, we construct the DtN map based on 
the Rayleigh expansion radiation conditon. Then the DtN map give rise to a transparent 
boundary conditon on the artificial boundary which truncates the unbounded domain.
